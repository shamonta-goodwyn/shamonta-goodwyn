**`Digital Security Eminence (Developer/Protector)`**

I'm a student in Cybersecurity and IT building my version of a safe digital world one step at a time. All projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my IT journey as a naive security officer with a passion for learning everything I could about this programming world - code, SIEM, Linux, networks, theory. And all the while, teaching myself software development with a dream of building my own program, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in security anyalis. A desire that landed me in a Cybersecurity degree at my local university. The want that is now a need to dive deeper into this rabbit hole of Wonderland's potential threats and counter them is where I am at now in life. Constantly learning. Constantly defending. My motto is "protect those that cannot protect themselves."
